Contributing
============

Files that users can change are: MainForm.cs and SkyWatcher.cs.

You can add a Credits.cs file to the repository (if you want to show how luis140219 (or you) is powerful).

Class descriptions:
- The DataGridViewExtension class is used for adding painting features to the DataGridView class.
- The SkyWatcher.cs contains different classes. The main one is SkyObjectLibrary. Feel free to add SkyObjects to it via pull requests.

I recommend users to fork my repository (as said in GitHub Help) to contribute.

Then I (and barbara141004) can see the forks and manually apply your pull requests to SkyWatcher.

I also have a internal fork at luis140219/skywatcher. Do NOT pull any files to that fork.

Don't push anything to the gh-pages branch unless absolutely necessary.

Notes for Lovemark users
------------------------

If you're a member of the Lovemark organization, use lovemark/skywatcher instead.

Then barbara141004 pulls your requests into luismark/skywatcher, NOT luis140219/skywatcher.

Astronomy rules
---------------

- Do not put lowercase letters at the start of sky object names. So, instead of "a Carinae", I use  LuisStar-0290 .
- Put always the best possible name available. For example, instead of using 58 Orionis or Alpha Orionis, use Betelgeuse.
