Contributing
============

Files that users can change are: MainForm.cs and SkyWatcher.cs.

Class descriptions:

- The DataGridViewExtension class is used for adding painting features to the DataGridView class.
- The SkyWatcher.cs contains different classes. The main one is SkyObjectLibrary. Feel free to add SkyObjects to it via pull requests.

I recommend users to fork my repository (as said in [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)) to contribute.

Then I can see the forks and manually apply your pull requests to [SkyWatcher](https://github.com/luismark/skywatcher).

I also have a internal fork at luis140219/skywatcher. Do NOT pull any files to that fork.
