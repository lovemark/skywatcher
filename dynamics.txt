I have an open issue #3. Anyone MUST fix it before the 8th of October.

SkyWatcher Dynamics:

Plane (with issue #3 open)
Cylinder (with issue #3 closed)

Fields of the Star class:

string Name (The star's name)
double RA (0 <= RA < 24)
double Dec (90 >= Dec >= -90)
Color displayColor (by default #46FFFF)
StarProperties Properties (is binary system and/or has variable magnitude)

Properties of the Star class:

bool IsNamed (has no spaces and/or doesn't contain its constellation genitive)

Example: Alpheratz

Name = "Alpheratz"
IsNamed = true
RA = 0.18(3)
Dec = 29.0
displayColor = #46FFFF (Color.FromArgb(70, 255, 255)
Properties = 1 (StarProperties.Double / binary system)

Methods of the Star class:

public int GetBestMonth()

Returns a number between 1 and 12 that specifies the best month to see this star
considering observation at midnight.

public Constellation GetConstellation()

Returns the constellation that this star belongs to.

public Point GetLocation(double relative_ra, double relative_dec)

Returns a System.Drawing.Point that specifies the form position of this star
(if outside of the form, returns a location outside of the form).

Maybe this method is the cause of the issue #3 I've mentioned earlier,
or it's a method on tehe MainForm class?
