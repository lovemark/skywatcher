skywatcher
==========

A sky guide written in C#. Download it in GitHub on in [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/skywatcher).

Contains over 250 stars and constellations (when finished it will contain over 1000).

Advantages over Google Earth Sky Viewer:

  * Doesn't require any kind of Internet connection.
  * It's smaller (my size limit is 1 MB and Google Earth doesn't fit that limit).

Has over 1 year of history!
