skywatcher
==========

A sky guide written in C#. Download it in GitHub on in [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/skywatcher).

Contains over 250 stars and constellations (when finished it will contain over 1000).

Advantages over Google Earth Sky Viewer:

  * Doesn't require any kind of Internet connection.
  * It's smaller (my size limit is 1 MB and Google Earth doesn't fit that limit).
  * It's free software (Google Earth is proprietary).

Has over 1 year of history!

Free software
=============

Free software must:

1. Allow everyone to distribute it in any way.
2. Allow everyone to study how the program works. For this, access to the source code is a prerequisite.
3. Allow everyone to modify the software in order to meet this three requirements.

Or, in code:

```text
var s = @@$"send(@@$%cmeet the following requirements:

1. Allow everyone to distribute it in any way.
2. Allow everyone to study how the program works. For this, access to the source code is a prerequisite.
3. Allow everyone to modify the software in order to format(%s,34,s,34).
